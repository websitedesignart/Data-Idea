name: forensic-test-engine
description: Runs a registered, deterministic forensic subtest (benford, duplicate-analysis, fuzzy-entity-match, cross-dataset-match, etc.) against a table/column in a case database and reports the recorded, auditable result. Use whenever the user asks to run a forensic test, check for fraud indicators, test Benford's Law, find duplicate or shared identifiers, or look for anomalies in imported case data.

This skill is the only sanctioned way to produce a forensic finding. It never
computes anything itself. It dispatches to the engine's `run_test.py`, which
validates required fields, runs the deterministic SQL/Python test, and writes the
result to the `_forensic` evidence tables and audit log. Never write ad hoc SQL or
pandas code as a substitute for a registered subtest, and never state a statistic or
conclusion that didn't come back from that script's JSON output.

## Finding the engine

The engine is the `forensic_platform` folder that sits **next to this SKILL.md**, so it
travels with the skill into whichever project uses it. Locate `run_test.py` at, in order:

1. `<project>/.claude/skills/forensic-test-engine/forensic_platform/scripts/run_test.py`
2. `~/.claude/skills/forensic-test-engine/forensic_platform/scripts/run_test.py`

If neither exists, stop and tell the user the skill folder is incomplete. Don't hunt
elsewhere or recreate the engine.

Run every command **from the project root**, because the engine reads database
connection details from that project's own `.mcp.json` (or from the path in
`FORENSIC_MCP_CONFIG`). If no `.mcp.json` is found, the engine says so and stops. Don't
work around it by inventing a connection string.

## Python

Use the project's own interpreter if it has one (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows,
`.venv/bin/python` elsewhere), otherwise `python`. The engine needs `pandas`, `openpyxl`,
`psycopg2` and `pyyaml`, listed in `requirements.txt` next to this file. If an import
fails, report which package is missing and stop. Don't install anything without asking.

## Available subtests

Read `forensic_platform/registry/test_registry.yaml` (next to this file) for the current
subtests and their status (`implemented`, `not_implemented`, or `extensible`). The
registry is the source of truth, so always read it rather than relying on this text.
If the user asks for a subtest whose status is not `implemented`, say so plainly and do
not attempt a manual equivalent.

Subtest-specific arguments for `run_test.py`:
- `benford`: numeric `--column` only, and only after the user has confirmed that column is an amount: ask them, then pass `--confirmed-by "<their name>"` (never invent a name). Without it the result is `"status": "declined"` with `REQUIRES_CONFIRMATION`. A `declined` result with `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` or `NOT_APPLICABLE` means the column cannot meaningfully be tested this way: report the `why` codes and stop. Use `--allow-unsuitable` only if the user insists after hearing that; the result is then an OBSERVATION for reference only, never a conformity claim. The suitability thresholds are unvalidated starting defaults: say so.
- `duplicate-analysis`: optional `--distinct-of <col>` (shared-identifier mode),
  `--min-occurrences N`, `--require-digit`, `--include-placeholders`.
- `fuzzy-entity-match`: required `--distinct-of <name col>`, optional
  `--threshold 0.55`, `--min-occurrences N`, `--require-digit`.
- `cross-dataset-match`: required `--right-table` and `--right-column`,
  optional `--right-schema`.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target: database, schema, table, and column(s) the subtest needs. If any of this is ambiguous, inspect the schema (a read-only database connection for that case, or `information_schema`). Never guess a name.
2. Look up the subtest's `required_fields` in the registry so you can explain what the test needs. Its limitations are not repeated in every result: read them once per method with `<python> <engine>/forensic_platform/scripts/describe_method.py <method>` (a result's `limits` field is exactly that argument, e.g. `benford@1.1.0`).
3. Run it from the project root:
   ```
   <python> <engine>/forensic_platform/scripts/run_test.py --database <db> --subtest <subtest> --schema <schema> --table <table> --column <column>
   ```
4. Parse the JSON response. Every result is one compact line with the same shape, keyed by `status`:
   - `"completed"`: the test ran. Fields: `verdict` (`SUPPORTED`, or `SUPPORTED_WITH_WARNING` with `why` codes: report them), `scanned` (rows examined), `class` (`OBSERVATION` or `ANOMALY`), `summary` (counts and statistics: quote them verbatim), `top` (up to 5 strongest signals; `signals` is the total, `top_truncated` if more exist), `dataset` (the version the result was computed on and how it was established), `run` and `finding_ids` (cite them), `evidence` (how to find the rows: `key` names the row-identity column(s), `links` counts the evidence rows), and `limits` (read it with `describe_method.py` and include what matters). A signal's `strength` is an effect size in 0 to 1, not a probability, and is not comparable between methods.
   - `"declined"`: the engine considered the test and decided this data does not suit it (see `verdict`, `why`, `next`). Report that; it is a finding about the data, not a failure to retry.
   - `"refused"`: a precondition failed (`code` such as `NO_SUCH_TABLE`, `NO_SUCH_COLUMN`, `NO_ROW_IDENTITY`, `UNSAFE_IDENTIFIER`, `MISSING_ARGUMENT`, `WRONG_COLUMN_TYPE`, `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `BAD_CONFIGURATION`). Report the exact `reason`. This is not an error to work around; it's the engine correctly refusing to guess.
   - `"error"`: something failed during execution. Report the `code` and `reason`; do not fabricate a result. If the code is `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` or `LOCK_TIMEOUT`, the engine protected the database by cancelling the query. Tell the user and ask before retrying. Never raise the `FORENSIC_*_TIMEOUT_MS` limits yourself. `RESULT_NOT_PRESENTABLE` means the run was recorded but its result could not be shown: report it.
   - Identifiers never appear in a result. A signal's `subject` is `ref:` plus 12 letters (a masked identifier: the same value always gives the same token in a project), `grp:` plus a label, or `row:` plus an index. If `summary.values` is `withheld`, no masking key was available and subjects are `grp:key_N` rank labels: report it. Refer to groups by subject and counts. Never try to recover, guess or ask the user to paste the underlying identifiers; if a person needs the rows, point them to the evidence links for the finding in the database. (`--reveal-values` and `--legacy-output` belong to a transition shape that will be removed; do not use them unless the user asks.)
5. Never upgrade a finding's classification yourself. An `ANOMALY` is a structural or statistical fact about the data, not evidence of fraud. Say so explicitly if the user's framing implies otherwise. Classification changes toward `INVESTIGATION LEAD` or `CONCLUSION` require human review, which is not yet built.

## First-time setup in a new project

Setup (creating a case database, importing an Excel file, creating the least-privilege role)
is a one-time task done by the user with the scripts in `forensic_platform/scripts/` and
`forensic_platform/ingestion/`. These change the database, so run them only when the user
asks, and show the command first.
